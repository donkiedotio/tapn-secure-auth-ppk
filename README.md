# Vaultiq

**Vaultiq** for effortless JWT authentication in Spring Boot microservices.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Vaultiq simplifies token-based security in distributed systems. It provides a developer-friendly DSL and integration hooks to issue, validate, and manage JWT tokens — without the overhead of a centralized auth server.

This library is opinionated yet flexible, designed for **modular integration** and **secure-by-default** Spring Boot setups.

## 🔍 Why Vaultiq?

Unlike Keycloak or Auth0, Vaultiq gives you **full control**, **zero external dependencies**, and **seamless Spring Boot integration**. It offers the right abstractions for token lifecycle management, with enough escape hatches to customize behavior.

Vaultiq is ideal for teams who want an internal auth system tailored to their domain logic without the learning curve of an external identity provider.
